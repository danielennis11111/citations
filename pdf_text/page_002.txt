Introduction to Neural Networks
Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of
interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. This concept is fundamental to understanding
modern AI systems. Research from leading institutions has shown that neural networks are
computational models inspired by biological neural networks. they consist of interconnected nodes
(neurons) organized in layers. Implementation details vary across different frameworks including
TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX. Performance benchmarks indicate significant improvements when
neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks. they consist of
interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Industry applications span healthcare, finance,
autonomous vehicles, and robotics. Future research directions include optimization, interpretability, and
robustness.
