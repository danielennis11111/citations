Bias in AI systems can perpetuate and amplify societal inequalities. This concept is fundamental to
understanding modern AI systems. Research from leading institutions has shown that bias in ai
systems can perpetuate and amplify societal inequalities. Implementation details vary across different
frameworks including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX. Performance benchmarks indicate significant
improvements when bias in ai systems can perpetuate and amplify societal inequalities. Industry
applications span healthcare, finance, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. Future research directions
include optimization, interpretability, and robustness.
